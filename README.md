# Reg-files-to-change-simple-settings
I got tired of having to manually enter some these registry entries at work to change simple settings, so I'm making a repository of common ones I use.


# Description of each file
Chrome Disable Print Preview.reg - This disables Google Chrome's built in print preview functionality.  Windows will use the system dialog when trying to print from Chrome.
Enable RDP.reg - does what it sounds like.  It changes the fDenyTSConnections registry entry to enable remote desktop on a machine
