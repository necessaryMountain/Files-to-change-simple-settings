# Reg files to change simple settings
I got tired of having to manually enter some these registry entries at work to change simple settings, so I'm making a repository of common ones I use.


# Description of each file
Chrome Disable Print Preview.reg - This disables Google Chrome's built in print preview functionality.  Windows will use the system dialog when trying to print from Chrome.
Enable RDP.reg - does what it sounds like.  It changes the fDenyTSConnections registry entry to enable remote desktop on a machine
Windows Disable News and Interests for all users.reg - This disables the news and interests feed for all users on a PC.  This completely disables the feature so users can't choose to turn it on or off because the option is not there.

Turn off energy efficient ethernet is a scipt that goes through two simple methods to turn off the setting of that name in ethernet adapters.  One will likely fail with a "no Matching" error because that property is called something slightly different.
